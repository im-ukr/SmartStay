# Dynamic Pricing System
The Final Pricing Model can be found here [notebooks/Dynamic Pricing Model/Final-model.ipynb](https://github.com/im-ukr/SmartStay/blob/test/notebooks/Dynamic%20Pricing%20Model/Final-model.ipynb)

## Installation 

Follow these instructions to setup your own instance of the app:

### 1: Clone the repo

```sh
git clone https://github.com/im-ukr/SmartStay
```

### 2: Cd to the folder

Open terminal/cmd/powershell and change directory/folder to the cloned folder. 

The command for the same would be

```sh
cd SmartStay
```

### 3: Install the PIP packages/dependencies

After you cd into the repo folder, ensure you see the following cmd/terminal prompt

```sh
Something.../SmartStay $
```

If not, repeat the previous step.

After this, run the following command in cmd/terminal:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4: Setup the database

To create the database from the MySQL schema, either:

1: Copy-paste the contents of [sql/smartstay.sql](sql/smartstay.sql) directly into the MySQL command line, or

2: Use the command to do it automatically (from cmd)

*Ensure that Path like "C:\Program Files\MySQL\MySQL Server 8.0\bin"(depending upon the location where it is installed) is present in your system environment variables.

```sh
get-content sql/smartstay.sql | mysql -u<username> -p<password>
```

This will create and setup the database. If the above command doesn't work then just copy paste the contents of this file in MySQL command line and execute it to set up the database.

(**<u>Note</u>**: Don't **include the "<>" angular brackets** in the command, and replace the `<username>` and `<password>` with the your credentials created in MySQL

### 5: Add database credentials to the app

In `.env` file(create it outside of all folders), it should contain `username` and `password` values of MySQL installed on your system. Example content: 
```sh
DB_PASSWORD="your-password"
DB_USER="your-username"
```

### 6: Installing Fonts

In order to make the app's gui look good, you will have to install the Montserrat font. From the `assets` folder, install all three fonts (with `.ttf` format) by double clicking them.

### 7: It's done ðŸŽ‰ | Run the app

Run `main.py` file with python 3 and you should see the login window, if you have followed each step correctly.

The default username and password are `username` and `password` respectively.
